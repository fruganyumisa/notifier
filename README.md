# Notifier

The **Notifier** is a Go-based application that periodically checks the connectivity of remote services and sends SMS notifications to administrators if any service becomes unreachable. It is designed to be simple, reliable, and easy to configure.

---

## Features

- **Periodic Service Checks**: Monitors services at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).
- **SMS Notifications**: Sends SMS alerts to multiple administrators if a service is down.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles termination signals (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) gracefully.
- **Configurable**: Supports configuration via environment variables or a customer env file.
- **HTTP Connectivity Checks**: Uses http to verify service availability
- **TCP Connectivity Checks**: Uses TCP (Telnet) to verify service availability. (WIP)


---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or higher
- An SMS gateway API endpoint (for sending notifications)

---

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fruganyumisa/notifier.git
   cd notifier
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o notifier ./cmd/notifier
   ```

---

## Configuration

The service can be configured using either a **Environment File** or **os environment variables**.

### Env File Configuration

Create a `config.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
SERVICES="http://host1:8080,http://host2:22"
CHECK_INTERVAL="5m"
SMS_GATEWAY_URL="http://sms-gateway.com/send
NOTIFIER_ADMIN_PHONES="+1234567890,+0987654321"
NOTIFIER_SENDER_HEADER="ALERTS"
```

### Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can configure the service using environment variables:

```bash
export NOTIFIER_SERVICES="http://host1:8080,http://host2:22"
export NOTIFIER_CHECK_INTERVAL="5m"
export NOTIFIER_SMS_GATEWAY_URL="http://sms-gateway.com/api/send"
export NOTIFIER_ADMIN_PHONES="+1234567890,+0987654321"
export NOTIFIER_SENDER_HEADER="ALERTS"
```

---

## Running the Service

Start the service using the following command:

```bash
./notifier
```

---

## SMS Message Template

When a service is down, the following SMS message is sent to administrators:

```
🚨 Service Alert 🚨

Service: {ServiceName}
Status: Down
Time: {Timestamp}

Details:
{FailureDetails}

Action Required:
Please investigate immediately. Check server logs and restart if necessary.
```

---

## Graceful Shutdown

The service supports graceful shutdown. When a termination signal (e.g., `Ctrl+C`) is received, it stops the monitoring process and cleans up resources before exiting.
